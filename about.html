            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <div class="bio-text">
                <p><strong>Krishnan Nair Shantakumari Chithra</strong> (born July 27, 1963) is an Indian playback singer and Carnatic musician who predominantly works in Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Hindi cinema. She is widely regarded as one of the greatest female playback singers in the history of Indian cinema.</p>
                
                <p>Born in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, into a family deeply rooted in music, Chithra showed extraordinary musical talent from early childhood. Her father, Krishnan Nair, was her first guru and recognized her exceptional gift for music. Under his guidance, she received rigorous training in Carnatic classical music.</p>
                
                <p>At just six years old, Chithra began formal training and won the coveted Kerala State Youth Festival award at the tender age of nine - a feat that would foreshadow her legendary career. Her classical foundation became the cornerstone of her unique singing style, characterized by perfect sruti (pitch), clarity, and emotional depth.</p>
                
                <p>Making her playback singing debut in 1979 with the Malayalam film "Attakalasham," Chithra quickly rose to prominence. Her breakthrough came in the 1980s when she collaborated with legendary music directors like Ilaiyaraaja, A.R. Rahman, M.M. Keeravani, and Johnson Master, establishing herself as the most sought-after female playback singer in South Indian cinema.</p>
